## Install

Install using your preferred package manager. For example;

``` bash
$ npm install --save-dev europa-test
```

You will most likely never need to depend on `europa-test` as it's only intended to be used to provide some general test
coverage for [Europa Core](https://github.com/neocotic/europa/tree/main/packages/europa-core) implementations. For
example:

* [europa](https://github.com/neocotic/europa/tree/main/packages/europa)
* [node-europa](https://github.com/neocotic/europa/tree/main/packages/node-europa)

Your implementation will also need to have `jasmine` installed as dependencies as these are used by this framework.
This too can be installed using your preferred package manager. For example;

``` bash
$ npm install --save-dev jasmine
```

## API

As this framework has to work in various environments, it only provides a high level test coverage of the core engine
using a selection of fixtures. In order to use this framework, you only have to provide `Europa`, loaded with your
implementation's `WindowService`, and a function which can be used to asynchronously load the test fixtures within this
framework on demand.

Most modules that use Europa Test will look something like the following:

``` typescript
import testEuropa from 'europa-test';

import Europa from '../path/to/ExampleEuropa';

testEuropa({
  Europa,
  loadFixture: (path) => someAsyncFileLoader(`../path/to/node_modules/europa-test/${path}`),
});
```
